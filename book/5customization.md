# Day 5: Customization

There are three kinds of customizations that we can do in XOOPS:

1. setting Preferences in XOOPS Core and in individual modules
2. hacks of the Core and the modules
3. theme customizations
 
#### Preferences

Almost each module has a set of Preferences, where the Admin can select and decide on individual aspects of the module, e.g. size of the thumbnail to be saved, size of the image to be accepted, number of records shown to the user.

#### Hacks

For hacks, there are several good sources on the XOOPS Website:

- XOOPS FAQ: [Hacks section](http://xoops.org/modules/smartfaq/category.php?categoryid=18)
- XOOPS Support Forums: [Hacks section](http://xoops.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?forum=15)
 
#### Themes

Due to the very modular architecture of XOOPS, the Webmasters can switch to different existing themes, or they can developed their own
