# Day 5: Customization

There are two kinds of customizations that we can do in XOOPS:

* setting Preferences in XOOPS Core and in individual modules
* hacks of the Core and the modules
 
Almost each module has a set of Preferences, where the Admin can select and decide on individual aspects of the module, e.g. size of the thumbnail to be saved, size of the image to be accepted, number of records shown to the user.

For hacks, there are several good sources on the XOOPS Website:

- XOOPS FAQ: [Hacks section](http://xoops.org/modules/smartfaq/category.php?categoryid=18)
- XOOPS Support Forums: [Hacks section](http://xoops.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?forum=15)
