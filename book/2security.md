# Day 2: Security

While many general Web tutorials talk about Security as one of the last subjects, for us it is the most important topic after the Installation! 

Before you do anything else, you have to make sure that your Website is secure!

We would like to point you again to the [**XOOPS Installation process**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/xoops/xoops-installation-guide/), where in [**Appendix 5**](https://xoops.gitbooks.io/xoops-installation-guide/content/book/appendix5.html), you will learn how to make your Website more secure.
