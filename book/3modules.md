# Day 3: Extend Functionality with Modules

Content is King and it is up to you to provide it. Module selection can be a bit overwhelming to some, but there are some good rules to follow as you start. Where I recommend you start is by identifying the types of content you want on your site and determine how often it will be updated.

The simplest web sites are pretty **static** - a few pages about you and your site, maybe some contact information and a few photos. You may even have an old site you have decided to move to XOOPS and you want an easier way to update the pages once in a while. Every site will have some of this type of content and there are a few options for this. Since we have not rushed into anything in this series, I am not about to break with tradition - start simple and with the content that won't require a lot of maintenance, then move on to more labor-intensive content.

As you examine the content you will be adding to your site, think about the ongoing effort needed to maintain it. If you start with a module that is very interactive and you get swamped with it, the other stuff just won't get done. Best to get some of the other things done first.

Also look at how one section might feed another - if, for example, you plan on having a lot of photos and select an album module, you will want to use your photos in other areas of your site pretty easily.

When evaluating modules, read this FAQ - it offers some great advice about selecting modules that are still being actively developed and supported, something important to the future of your content.

This is not an exhaustive list of content types, but these are the most common. You could have a site with all these modules and more, but you can also have sites with as few as 2 modules.
