# Day 1: Installation

There is a very detailed tutorial showing the whole [**XOOPS Installation process**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/xoops/xoops-installation-guide/), and we highly recommend to review it there.


The overall Installation process flow is depicted in this chart:

Efforts have been made to ensure this is not merely a sequential installation document. Useful tips and pointers about XOOPS are provided as the user is guided successfully through the installation process.

To proceed successfully, the following is required on either a local machine or hosted server:

1) a place to run that includes:

    a. the Apache web server; 
    b. the database manager MySQL;
    c. scripting language PHP, either on a Linux or a Windows platform; and


2) a downloaded copy of the latest XOOPS version (currently **[2.5.7.1](https://xoops.org/modules/core/)**).

In the provided video we'll show you how you can install XOOPS in 10-15 minutes, and do the basic configuration within 20-30 minutes, so the whole installation should not take more than 60 minutes.
